/**
 * Decision logic for media the player refuses to end (#1673).
 *
 * media3 reports `StuckPlayerException.STUCK_PLAYING_NOT_ENDING` when the player
 * sits in STATE_READY past the declared duration while no renderer ever reports
 * itself ended. Observed on a tunneled MTK decoder (Fire TV 4K Max): the clock
 * ran a full minute past the last frame behind a black screen, so nothing ever
 * completed the item — no Play Next, no auto-play, and a "playing" timeline the
 * server kept extrapolating past the item duration. The leading hypothesis is
 * that the tunneled end-of-stream buffer never arrives; what the evidence
 * establishes is only that the renderers never end.
 *
 * The stuck report alone cannot mean "finished": the same condition holds for a
 * container that under-declares its duration and is legitimately still playing.
 * The rendered-frame counter separates the two — a finished file has stopped
 * painting, an under-declared one has not.
 *
 * Inputs are deliberately the core's own bookkeeping rather than live player
 * state: media3 has already stopped the player by the time the report arrives,
 * so its timeline and track selection may be gone.
