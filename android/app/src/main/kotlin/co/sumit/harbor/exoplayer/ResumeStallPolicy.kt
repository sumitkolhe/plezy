/**
 * Decision logic for the post-resume video stall watchdog (#1454).
 *
 * Some TV SoCs (the Amlogic Mi Box class) stall the MediaCodec output path after a
 * pause -> resume: the playback clock and audio keep advancing but no new video
 * frame reaches the screen until the codec is flushed by a seek. The watchdog
 * snapshots the rendered-frame counter when playback resumes and evaluates it one
 * check window later; a confirmed stall is recovered with a small backward seek
 * (ExoPlayer short-circuits a same-position seek without resetting renderers, so
 * the recovery must move by a nonzero delta to force the codec flush).
