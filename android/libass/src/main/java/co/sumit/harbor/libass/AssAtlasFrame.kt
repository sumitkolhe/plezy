/**
 * Result of a packed-atlas render. The atlas pixel data is stored in the direct ByteBuffer
 * that was passed into [AssRender.renderFrameAtlas]; the vertex stream is in the other.
 *
 * The atlas may span more than one *page* — a heavy full-screen sign can produce more
 * sub-pixels than a single GL-max texture holds. Pages are vertically stacked in the
 * atlas ByteBuffer (page `p` at byte offset `p * atlasWidth * atlasMaxHeight`), each its
 * own texture, and are drawn in turn. Quads are emitted in libass painter order and page
 * assignment is monotonic in that order, so each page's quads form one contiguous run in
 * the vertex stream ([pageQuadCounts]); the runner uploads page `p`, then draws its run.
 *
 * Built in Kotlin by [AssRender.renderFrameAtlas] from the int[] header the native
 * renderer fills (see `writeAtlasHeader` in AssKt.c) — never constructed from JNI, so
 * the minifier may obfuscate it freely without breaking the native boundary.
 *
 * @param atlasWidth     atlas row stride in pixels (= the allocated width; same for every
 *                       page; 0 when [changed] == 0)
 * @param pageHeights    packed height (rows worth uploading) of each page; `size` = page count
 * @param pageQuadCounts quads on each page, contiguous in the vertex stream in this order;
 *                       `size` = page count, `sum` = [quadCount]
 * @param quadCount      total quads; the vertex buffer holds [quadCount] * 6 vertices
 * @param changed        libass change flag (0 = no change, 1 = positions, 2 = content)
 * @param truncated      images dropped because the frame needed more than [requiredPages]
 *                       pages of capacity or exceeded the vertex budget; the frame is
 *                       incomplete but never stale (should be unreachable for real content)
 * @param requiredPages  pages this frame needs to render completely. When it exceeds
 *                       [pageHeights].size the caller must grow the atlas buffer and
 *                       re-render; the rendered pages are still valid in the meantime.
 * @param hasOutput      true when libass reported at least one visible image for this
 *                       timestamp, even when [changed] is 0 and the buffers were not
 *                       rewritten. false means this timestamp should be blank.
