/**
 * Thin binding over the `EGL_ANDROID_get_frame_timestamps` extension.
 *
 * The atlas pipeline pins each overlay swap to the video frame's `releaseTimeNs`,
 * but the swap loop can only measure when [android.opengl.EGL14.eglSwapBuffers]
 * *returns* — i.e. when the buffer was queued, not when SurfaceFlinger actually
 * presented it. That can't reveal a one-vsync compositor latch offset, which is
 * exactly the error frame-perfection work chases. This binding reads the buffer's
 * *actual on-screen present time* so it can be compared against `releaseTimeNs`
 * (the video frame's vsync target) as ground truth.
 *
 * `android.opengl.EGLExt` exposes only `eglPresentationTimeANDROID`; the
 * frame-timestamp entry points are resolved natively via `eglGetProcAddress`.
 *
 * Requires Android 10 (API 29)+ and the extension; probe with [nativeInit].
 * All calls must run on the GL thread with the pipeline's EGL context current.
