///   a single watch never produces two writes.
/// * Threshold trackers (MAL, AniList) are notified exactly once when progress
///   crosses the watched threshold, with a safety-net fire on stop if the

/// * Manual, container, offline-replay, external-player and server-observed
///   marks bypass playback entirely and go straight to [Tracker.markWatched] on
///   every tracker that can write.
///
/// A failed per-item history write is persisted in [TrackerWriteQueue] and
/// replayed by [flushWriteQueue], so a transient error does not silently drop a
