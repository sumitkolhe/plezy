/// True when a failed write says nothing about the write itself, so retrying it
/// later is the right answer and it must not spend one of a queued item's
/// attempts.
///
/// Four shapes qualify:
///
/// * The request never arrived — a timeout or transport error. A link coming
///   back up is no proof the endpoint is reachable, so counting these would let
///   a handful of connectivity flaps drop a watch.
/// * The service rate-limited us. Explicitly retryable, and typed only by the
///   services that say so — others surface a 429 as a plain
///   [TrackerApiException].
/// * The service failed on its own side (5xx). A bad hour for a service is not
///   evidence that this watch is unwritable.
/// * A token refresh failed recoverably. [TrackerAuthException.isPermanent] is
///   the services' own verdict: false means the refresh endpoint misbehaved
///   (5xx, network), true means the session is genuinely dead.
///
/// What is left counting is an answer *about the write*: 4xx says this item, on
/// this account, will not be written however often we ask. The consequence is
/// that a service returning 5xx indefinitely keeps its rows queued rather than
/// dropping them — deliberate, since the alternative is losing watches to an
/// outage, and rows coalesce per remote row so repeats do not accumulate.
