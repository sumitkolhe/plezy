/// The host is deliberately absent from `android/app/src/main/res/xml/
/// network_security_config.xml`: these URLs are handed to the platform browser
/// through `url_launcher` and are never fetched by the app's own HTTP stack,
/// so they are not fixed endpoints to pin. `test/android/
/// network_security_config_test.dart` enforces that distinction for the
/// services that *do* make requests.
