/// Dims the content beneath it by drawing a translucent [color] quad on top,
/// as a saveLayer-free replacement for wrapping the content in
/// [AnimatedOpacity]. Widget opacity below 1.0 forces an offscreen render
/// pass every frame — a permanent GPU cost on the weak GLES devices most
/// Android TVs are — while a color-blended quad is free. Over a
/// [color]-colored underlay the result is mathematically identical to
/// `Opacity(opacity: 1 - alpha)`; over artwork it darkens toward [color]
/// instead of turning translucent.
///
/// Unlike content opacity, the quad also darkens whatever shows through
/// gaps in the content, so its rectangle boundary can read as a hard line
/// across backdrop artwork. [fadeTop]/[fadeBottom] soften that by ramping
/// the dim in over a band of pixels. The bands are gradient-shaded, which
/// costs GPU per covered pixel on low-end TVs — keep them narrow; the
/// interior stays a flat quad.
///
/// Stack this above the content (with `IgnorePointer` built in so taps pass
/// through). Animates with [FocusTheme.getAnimationDuration], so the full
/// tier fades and the reduced tier snaps.
